      <p>CPACS is an enterprise system used by NYUâ€™s Office of Construction Management to keep track of money being used on big projects across the campuses. As with many enterprise systems, it deals with a heavy amount of information, which in and of itself is an impressive feat. However, something about using it was causing many users great frustration.
        <br><br>
        In October 2017, I was put in charge of redesigning the interface.

      <h2 class="main__project__details__h2">My Role</h2>
      <p>I led the hands on redesign of CPACS starting October 2017. I collaborate with another designer on the document workflow modules and collaborated with a product owner, a user support personnel, a systems architect, and two frontend developers.
        <br>
        The project is still ongoing. A module is redesigned and implemented every month, with the project expecting to be finished in 2020.
