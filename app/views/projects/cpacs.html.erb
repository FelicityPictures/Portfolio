    <h1>Legacy System Redesign (In progress)</h1>
    <p class="main_Info--paragraphText">
      As part of NYU IT OTSS, one of my projects is to redesign the legacy enterprise system, CPACS, used to manage construction projects. The system is heavily document workflow based. Whenever a new employee is hired, they must go through several hours of training in order to learn how to use the software.
    </p>
    <p class="main_Info--paragraphText">
      The CPACS redesign involves converting a non-scalable desktop application to an accessible web browser application that can later be expanded to encompass other fields of professional work as well.
    </p>

      <h2>Issues with old CPACS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Not scalable</li>
        <li>Outdated layout for information</li>
        <li>Information dense, hard to look at</li>
        <li>Not accessible</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p class="main_Info--paragraphText">
        Redesign a legacy system so that it is easier to use but still familiar to old users.
      </p>

    <h2>Application Navigation</h2>
    <p class="main_Info--paragraphText">
      The user would typically navigate through CPACS exclusively with a sidebar. <i>Everything</i> is found in the sidebar, which means it is a scroll intensive endeavor to find anything in the hierarchy of folders.
    </p>
    <p class="main_Info--paragraphText">
      We decided to retain some aspects of of the old CPACS by keeping primary navigation through the sidebar.
    </p>
    <p class="main_Info--paragraphText">
      Inspired by Appleâ€™s visual display of information architecture in the Settings app for the iPhone, we utilized cards to display the names of each document type a project would have.
      Hierarchies no longer all exist exclusively in the sidebar, making the sidebar experience more clean and less scroll intensive.

    <p class="main_Info--paragraphText">
      Pages utilize a lot more empty space and a vertical grouping of information header and actual information so that the users are able to easily and quickly find information.
    </p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p class="main_Info--paragraphText">
      CPACSweb is currently still in the works. Every few weeks, we sign off on a part of the project that we will implement into the old system. After a part has been implemented, we do user testing and collect user feedback in order to improve our designs for the next iteration.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The plan is to replace the old CPACS with CPACSweb part by part until eventually, the whole system has been redesigned.
